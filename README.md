# Automated-Code-Judge
LAN connected code judge system

It is more or less like PC^2 software. This project was done in the "Software Enginnering Sessional".

Problems Faced:

It was my very first project in Python. So learning a language and doing a projet was not easy. So in most of the case the code is not well written which I learnt later.

OBJECTIVE & AIM:
1.	To create an automated lab environment.
2.	To ease the evaluation process and also to make the evaluation more accurate.
3.	To save time on both teachers and students end so that lab works can be more productive.
4.	To create an automated system for grading and keeping records of class performance easily.

KEY FEATURES:
1.	A software system along with an automated judge embedded in the system.
2.	Teachers will have accounts and will be able to upload the lab question and some test cases to evaluate student’s solution.
3.	Students will also have accounts and will be given permission to specific courses given by teachers.
4.	On the lab day students will be provided question having certain problem statements. After solving them they will be able to submit their solution through the software system interface. This solution will be judged in a server PC via the “Automated Judge System” and proper verdict will be sent to their corresponding PC’s application interface.
5.	According to the verdict certain scores will awarded to the specific student and will be recorded in the database which can be accessed by the teacher later.
6.	A rank list will also be provided during a certain lab day so that students and teachers both can review relative performances.

DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM DETAILS:

•	Platform: Desktop based application. ( basically a client-server model via Ethernet was implemented)

•	Language: 

  o	Front-End: For the front end used Python 3.4. ( Tkinter for GUI)
  
  o	Database: SQLite
